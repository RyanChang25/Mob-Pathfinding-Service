# Mob Pathfinding Service

## Overview

`Mob Pathfinding Service`, is a simple service I created that uses OOP in order to handle large amounts of AI mobs. The `OOP` implementation allows for different mobs types to be rendered and updated with only a single table. Moreover, since this service is all under a single module it allows users to customize the service easily. This service was often used in some of my older games. _(Can send RBXL file upon request)_
